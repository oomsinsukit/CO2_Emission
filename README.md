# Project for Portfolio
Develop a predictive model for CO2 emissions using a vehicle dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to analyze vehicle attributes and accurately predict CO2 emissions.  
The process will involve data cleaning, feature selection, and model development using algorithms like Linear Regression or Random Forest Model.
Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared, and root mean squared error (RMSE) to ensure predictive accuracy and reliability.
